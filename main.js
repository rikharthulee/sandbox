/*You are sat with two frogs on a log, Chris and Tom. They are arguing about who ate the most flies (Poor flies, but what you going to do!). Chris says "I ate the summation of n number of flies!". 

Tom replies "Take half the number you ate then round it down and work out the summation of that, that is how many I ate"!

Cat then hops onto the log looking pleased with herself "Well, I ate the summation of both your dinners combined." Loz who came late to this meeting of amphibians is very confused, he asks "So how many did each of you eat?" 

Write a function called "frog_contest" that takes in a number(n) - then returns a string - 'Chris ate {number} flies, Tom ate {number} flies and Cat ate {number} flies.'*/

export default function frog_contest(n) {
  //The amphibians at School of Frog are counting on you!
}
